 Problem Statement 1: Skill Swap Platform

 Overview

Develop **Skill Swap**, a web-based mini application that allows users to list the skills they can offer and request skills they want to learn in return. The platform promotes community-driven learning through peer-to-peer exchanges without involving money.


 Objectives

* Enable users to showcase skills they can teach and learn from others.
* Allow users to initiate skill exchange requests based on mutual interests.
* Provide a seamless user experience for managing skill swaps.
* Include an admin panel to ensure platform integrity and moderation.


 User Features

 Profile Management

* Collect user details: name, optional location, and profile photo.
* Users can list:

  * Skills they can offer
  * Skills they want to learn
  * Their availability (e.g., weekends, evenings)
* Option to set profile visibility: public or private.

 Search and Discovery

* Browse or search for other users based on specific skills (e.g., "Photoshop", "Excel").
* View user profiles, skill details, and availability.

 Skill Swap Functionality

* Users can send skill swap requests by selecting a skill they want to learn and offering one of their own skills in return.
* Recipients can accept or reject swap requests.
* Users can view their:

  * Pending requests
  * Ongoing or accepted swaps
* Users can delete a swap request if it has not been accepted.
* After a swap, users can leave ratings or feedback.

Admin Features

* Moderate and reject inappropriate or spammy skill listings.
* Ban users who violate community policies or misuse the platform.
* Monitor all swap activity: pending, accepted, or cancelled.
* Send platform-wide announcements (e.g., updates, maintenance alerts).
